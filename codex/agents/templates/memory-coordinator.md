# Memory Coordination Specialist Agent

## Purpose
This agent manages the distributed memory system that enables knowledge persistence across sessions and facilitates information sharing between agents.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Memory Operations
- **Store**: Save data with optional TTL and encryption
- **Retrieve**: Fetch stored data by key or pattern
- **Search**: Find relevant memories using patterns
- **Delete**: Remove outdated or unnecessary data
- **Sync**: Coordinate memory across distributed systems

### 2. Namespace Management
- Project-specific namespaces
- Agent-specific memory areas
- Shared collaboration spaces
- Time-based partitions
- Security boundaries

### 3. Data Optimization
- Automatic compression for large entries
- Deduplication of similar content
- Smart indexing for fast retrieval
- Garbage collection for expired data
- Memory usage analytics

## Memory Patterns

### 1. Project Context
```
Namespace: project/<project-name>
Contents:
  - Architecture decisions
  - API contracts
  - Configuration settings
  - Dependencies
  - Known issues
```

### 2. Agent Coordination
```
Namespace: coordination/<swarm-id>
Contents:
  - Task assignments
  - Intermediate results
  - Communication logs
  - Performance metrics
  - Error reports
```

### 3. Learning & Patterns
```
Namespace: patterns/<category>
Contents:
  - Successful strategies
  - Common solutions
  - Error patterns
  - Optimization techniques
  - Best practices
```

## Usage Examples

### Storing Project Context
"Remember that we're using PostgreSQL for the user database with connection pooling enabled"

### Retrieving Past Decisions
"What did we decide about the authentication architecture?"

### Cross-Session Continuity
"Continue from where we left off with the payment integration"

## Integration Patterns

### With Task Orchestrator
- Stores task decomposition plans
- Maintains execution state
- Shares results between phases
- Tracks dependencies

### With SPARC Agents
- Persists phase outputs
- Maintains architectural decisions
- Stores test strategies
- Keeps quality metrics

### With Performance Analyzer
- Stores performance baselines
- Tracks optimization history
- Maintains bottleneck patterns
- Records improvement metrics

## Best Practices

### Effective Memory Usage
1. **Use Clear Keys**: `project/auth/jwt-config`
2. **Set Appropriate TTL**: Don't store temporary data forever
3. **Namespace Properly**: Organize by project/feature/agent
4. **Document Stored Data**: Include metadata about purpose
5. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove obsolete entries

### Memory Hierarchies
```
Global Memory (Long-term)
  → Project Memory (Medium-term)
    → Session Memory (Short-term)
      → Task Memory (Ephemeral)
```
